                <p>One of the events associated with my Genetic Mechanism and Evolution training grant is an annual hackathon.
                  As the training grant supports students with varying levels of computational experience, one of the aims is to improve
                  computational literacy. Given my computational experience, I volunteered to be on the organizing committee. The theme 
                  we chose for the hackathon was <strong>interactive plotting</strong>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The value of interactive plots is obvious, but it is the type of thing where the "activation energy" of actually learning
                  to make them and deploy them in practice is high enough of a barrier for adoption. We therefore slotted the event for a 
                  period of two days, starting with a few short tutorial lectures followed by 10+ hours of "hacking" sessions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The tutorials we made can be be found in this <a href="https://github.com/SaideepGona/ai-science-training-series/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo.</a>
                  Basically, the tutorials include plotly + dash in both R and Python as well as rshiny for R. These are the major relevant interactive
                  plotting libraries which would be practical for researchers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As something of an experimental event, we were super pleased with how it went! People ended up splitting into 4 groups 
                  based on their programming language preference. Although we provided a curated dataset to practice with, it ended up being more 
                  natural for people to use their own datasets from personal or research interests. We ended up having people work with 
                  several approaches:

                  <ul>
                    <li>Python: Plotly + Dash</li>
                    <li>R: Plotly + Dash</li>
                    <li>R: Rshiny + ggplot</li>
                    <li>R: Rshiny + plotly + ggplot</li>
                  </ul>

                </p>
                <p>
                  Interestingly, it was found that:
                  
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Plotly + Dash are not as well developed in R as in Python, such that it is better 
                      to use Python if favoring these libraries.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Converting ggplot plots to plotly and then embedding in RShiny can work, but adds many layers of 
                      abstraction which should be avoided if possible.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Overall, it was an enriching experience, well worth the time off from the daily research grind. On my
                  end, I used some of my spare time to build an interactive RShiny app showcasing some of my recent research 
                  results. It is hosted <a href="https://imlab.shinyapps.io/xwas_shiny_app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a>

                <p>Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) hosts regular workshops and trainings to improve AI researcher's capacity
                  to adopt AI into their work and make use of their vast supercompute resources. I attended the AI for Science Training Series,
                  a multi-lecture series with homeworks. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/SaideepGona/ai-science-training-series/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repo.</a>

                </p>
                <p>
                  I do have a pretty solid machine learning/AI background, but I still found the series very useful. For one, ALCF has one of the most
                  powerful GPU clusters in the world. Even though we have been able to utilize these resources ourselves to perform inference and training,
                  there is still a great deal we don't know about this infrastructure. For example, ALCF also experiments with AI testbeds housing 
                  up-and-coming specialized hardware resources. Some of these hardware, like groq-chips, could proliferate due to their efficient 
                  inference potential relative to standard NVIDIA A100 gpus. It was cool to get some exposure to these technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another nice benefit of this series was that it gave me a chance to revisit the mathematics of transformers, specifically self-attention.
                  I've been pretty busy so I never really had a chance to sit down and properly derive the math at the core of the hubub surrounding 
                  LLMs. During my Master's coursework at CMU it was the standard to build every neural network architecture from scratch which, at the time,
                  where primarily:

                  <ol>
                    <li>Fully connected layers</li>
                    <li>Convolutional filters</li>
                    <li>Recurrent neural nets</li>
                  </ol>

                  It therefore bothered me that I didn't really have the "best" intuitive understanding of self-attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fortunately, self-attention isn't as complicated as it seems. What helped me is to just think of attention as analogous to other neural network
                  layers, such as those mentioned above. In essence, they all operate as functions which map inputs to outputs via linear transformations with added 
                  weights. From that perspective, self-attention is just a different way of performing such transformations. What it does have is a number of 
                  desirable properties over other architectures for language-based tasks. I made a little diagram/explainer 
                  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pFi4Nw7OgvUJJtTfypotlZLNq6Yhdiag/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here!</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, after completing all the assignments, the ALCF people were so kind as to give me a digital badge for my efforts :).

                  COVID (the workshops were discontinued during COVID). Shoutout to Vivaswat(Viv), my friend and colleague who is a certified instructor
                  and who was the primary organizer of this workshop.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The theme was to help beginners refresh their knowledge in the programming language R (most common among biomedical researchers) as
                  well as give a walkthrough of plotting using the ggplot package. These are workhorse tools for allowing researchers to be 
                  able to analyze and present their experiemental results.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The event itself took place over a single day. Viv is a natural presenter and really smooth coding to an audience. As volunteers, 
                  our main goal was to help resolve issues along the way so everyone could keep up with the lesson. The epxerience definitely solidified
                  my interest in becoming a certified instructor. For one, it was obvious how useful the single day was for the participants. Most of them
                  are super motivated because of their own immediate research goals. Interestingly, even for us advanced programmers there were so many little 
                  tricks which were shared that most of us weren't even aware of! It definitely goes to show that reviewing the basics is never a waste of time,
                  and teaching is the best way to achieve mastery.

                  Despite being in the academic setting for many years and developing extensive research experience, this is somehow my first *actual* conference I've attended. 
                  There is certainly a duality here. I have plenty of experience achieving the <b>technical</b> requirements of research like data analysis, writing code, reading papers, 
                  on the web, etc. <b>However</b>, attending the conference made me realize how it was always difficult for me to undsertand the softer aspacts of the research space. 
                  How projects are funded, research directions prioritized, and my favorite: who exactly are those people who's names I hear so often??

                                    <p>I attended Parslfest 2023. Parsl is a workflow management python package. It is especially good for scalably running tasks in parallel on remote computing resources.
                                    It has proven invaluable in being able to scale up our personalized Enformer inference on Argonne National Labratory's Polaris compute cluster. Our Parsl pipelines are showcased <a href="https://github.com/SaideepGona/shared_pipelines">here.</a>
                                    As a result, we have worked quite closely with the Parsl Devs who are based out of UChicago and Argonne National Labs. Parslfest is an event they host every year where
                                    they discuss updates and showcase projects. This year, my good friend in the lab Temi is presenting our Enformer inference pipeline.

                                    <p>Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) hosts regular workshops and trainings to improve AI researcher's capacity
                                      to adopt AI into their work and make use of their vast supercompute resources. I attended the AI for Science Training Series,
                                      a multi-lecture series with homeworks. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/SaideepGona/ai-science-training-series/tree/main">repo.</a>

                                      I do have a pretty solid machine learning/AI background, but I still found the series very useful. For one, ALCF has one of the most
                                      powerful GPU clusters in the world. Even though we have been able to utilize these resources ourselves to perform inference and training,
                                      there is still a great deal we don't know about this infrastructure. For example, ALCF also experiments with AI testbeds housing 
                                      up-and-coming specialized hardware resources. Some of these hardware like groq-chips, could proliferate due to their efficient 
                                      inference potential relative to standard NVIDIA A100 gpus. 

                                      Another nice benefit of this series was that it gave me a chance to revisit the mathematics of transformers, specifically self-attention.
                                      I've been pretty busy so I never really had a chance to sit down and properly derive the math at the core of the hubub surrounding 
                                      LLMs. What helped me is to just think of attention as analogous to other neural network layers, such as fully connected layers which map
                                      inputs to outputs via linear transformations with added weights. From that perspective, self-attention is just a different way of performing
                                      such transformations which has a number of desirable properties over other layers for language-based tasks. I made a little diagram/explainer 
                                      <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pFi4Nw7OgvUJJtTfypotlZLNq6Yhdiag/view?usp=sharing">here!</a>

                                      Finally, after completing all the assignments, the ALCF people were so kind as to give me a digital badge for my efforts :).
